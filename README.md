# Emotion_detection_using_CNN
This project implements an Emotion Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify facial expressions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. It leverages transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet and VGGNet to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
